Hi, I’m Maxime. I’m a graduate student in atmospheric and oceanic sciences at Princeton University, working in the Resplandy Research Group on ocean and atmosphere dynamics.

Previously, I worked on geochemistry and compositional data analysis, including estimating rock composition from replicate geochemical analyses and studying acid sulfate alteration in Panarea, Italy. I’m currently pursuing my PhD at Princeton (expected 2028).
